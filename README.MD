# List and Directory change utility

Bouncing between Directories can be challenging.

When I startup a terminal and open many Tabs 
I want to quickly change all of them to a specific 
Directory.  Now I can easily.  I just "cd" to the
path of on the 1st tab then lcd 1 on each of the others.

```
CD_CMD
➜ lcd
     1	/Users/wendellwolfe/goto
     2	/Users/wendellwolfe
     3	/Users/wendellwolfe/Applications/Chrome Apps.localized/Google Chat.app/Contents
     4	/Users/wendellwolfe/go
     5	/Users/wendellwolfe/WW/CD_CMD/test2
     6

CD_CMD
➜ lcd 3

Chrome Apps.localized/Google Chat.app/Contents
➜ bk

CD_CMD
➜
```
